v 3.0		02-07-2019
	Structural overhaul as DLC mod - RCI is now a much more compact and
	standalone component, which should reduce compatibility problems.

fixed:
		- Last played civ has default icons instead of RCI's
			(when installed	as a mod)
		- "More Luxuries" incompatibility: tile improvements can't be built on
			More Luxuries tiles (when installed as MPMPM DLC - this seemed to be
			true of all MPMPM packs, not just RCI)
		- Game crashes at Renaissance due to errors in Mongol data
			(when installed by overwriting assets)
